## Another collection of DS note to self, hopefully useful to you as well, gentle reader.

This really is data science notes to self future self. So it's less about demonstrating ability and more about recording stuff I wish I'd been told earlier.  HTH!

## About Me Doing Data Science:

I've done data science in the SF bay area for a wide variety of clients, from travel and user ancestry to real estate, furniture and wine, in B2C and B2B contexts.  

I would say my main insight from my professional experience is to consider enterprise reporting as a total cycle in which the company's self-understanding and memory are leveled-up.  In this sense, the desktop or cloud-based data-science we do (version testing, modelling) is something we should plan to eventually use in reporting when it yeilds insight. Put it this way: if we **wouldn't** eventually change our enterprise reporting with significant outcomes of potential research, it might mean that research doesn't relate to our KPIs, isn't going to improve our institutional self-understanding and so shouldn't be a priority.  

With this cycle in mind, I like to keep my hand in everything a bit: I work to improve not just my modelling but signal capture, pipeline processes, and reporting layer improvements that we use to improve company awareness.  On which more later...
