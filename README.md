## Another collection of DS notes to self, hopefully useful to you as well, gentle reader.

This really is data science notes to self future self. So it's less about demonstrating ability and more about recording stuff I wish I'd been told earlier.  HTH!

This site was made from this [template](https://github.com/mgoold/ds_template).  You're welcome to use it!

## About Me Doing Data Science:

I've done data science in the SF bay area for a wide variety of clients, from travel and user ancestry to real estate, furniture and wine, in B2C and B2B contexts.  

I would say my main insight from my professional experience is to consider enterprise reporting as a total cycle in which the company's self-understanding and memory are leveled-up.  In this sense, we should desktop or cloud-based data-science (version testing, modelling) because we plan to eventually use the insights in enterprise reporting. 

Put it this way: if your research insights **wouldn't** eventually improve our enterprise reporting, it might mean that the research doesn't relate to your KPIs, isn't going to improve institutional decision-making, and so shouldn't be a priority.  Conversely: if you can't get from within your enterprise reporting to the research-derived factors that explain it, you should consider reporting improvements that will let you do so.

With this cycle in mind, I like to keep my hand in everything a bit: I work to improve not just my modelling but signal capture, pipeline processes, and reporting layer improvements that we use to improve company awareness.  On which more later in these pages.
