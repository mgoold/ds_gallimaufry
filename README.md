## Another collection of DS notes to self, hopefully useful to you as well.

This really is data science notes to self future self. So it's less about demonstrating ability and more about recording stuff I need to keep in mind for work.  HTH!

This site was made from this [template](https://github.com/mgoold/ds_template).  You're welcome to use it!

## About Me Doing Data Science:

For about 15 years, I've done data science in the SF bay area for a wide variety of clients, from travel and user ancestry to real estate, furniture and wine, in B2C and B2B contexts.
